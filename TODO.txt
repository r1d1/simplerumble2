- Scene 2: But one day, one of them ate the Root of Discord, and became the Evil SheepLord.
- Scene 3: He started gathering followers and invading peaceful meadows ...
- Scene 4: ... killing many innocent lambs and ewes and capturing fellow sheeps to sacrifice to the Tree of Evil.
- Scene 5: Hopefully, a group of fellow sheep leaders have started fighting against the Evil Lord.

- Building: Park (allow for grass production), BellyMassaging (gas prod), ExtraCutter3000 (wool prod), Nursery (sheep prod)
- unit:
-- base sheep can produce resources/build factories
-- Adds mecha at some point (either in base game or extension)
- unit factory
- "Movie animation" : background layer, middle layer, front layer
- General animation that support movie and normal animations ?
